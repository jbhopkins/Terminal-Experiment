**SABER FENCING**

Saber is the only one that allows you to score using the edge of the blade.

“Saber fencing is like Formula 1 racing,” said U.S. Olympic men’s saber fencer Daryl Homer. “It’s aggressive, fast and requires split-second decision making.”

Each point is over in a matter of seconds as the two combatants lunge at each other with swords honed in on making a hit tracked by an electronic system. Footwork on the competition strip is quick. And lunges are often accompanied by loud shouts in both men’s and women’s competitions.
